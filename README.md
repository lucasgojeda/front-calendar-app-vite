# Calendar App

_Application to schedule events_

## Requirements and tutorial 🚀

To make this project work it is required as first to have installed **node js**

Then it is required to enter the following command in the console:
```
$ npm i
```

Then you must make sure that the environment variable corresponding to the api address is correctly set in the environment variables, one is already set by default pointing to a [backend developed on node js](https://github.com/lukitasojeda/back-calendar-app-vite).

Done, the application is ready to be started with the following command:
```
$ npm run dev
```
